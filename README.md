Additional Notes

Backend API: The code assumes that a backend API is available to handle product data, user authentication, and order processing. You'll need to replace the placeholder URLs with the actual endpoints of your backend API.</br>
Error handling: Consider implementing proper error handling mechanisms to provide informative feedback to users in case of unexpected issues.</br>
Testing: Writing unit and integration tests can help ensure the code's quality and maintainability.</br>
Deployment: If you plan to deploy the application, explore options like creating a build and hosting it on a web server.</br>
